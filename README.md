# **Library Management System**

This project presents a fully functional **Library Management System** designed to streamline the daily operations of a library. Built using **SQL**, the system manages critical data related to books, customers, employees, and branch operations. It efficiently tracks book inventories, rentals, returns, and provides insights through analytical queries.

## **SQL Queries & Data Insights**

A range of SQL queries have been implemented to derive meaningful insights from the data. Key analytical tasks include:

1. **Fetch book titles, categories, and rental prices** for all currently available books.
2. **List all employees along with their salaries**, sorted in descending order of pay.
3. **Match issued books with customers** to show who has borrowed which books.
4. **Count the number of books in each category** to evaluate collection size by genre.
5. **Identify employees earning over Rs. 50,000**, showing their names and job roles.
6. **Find customers registered before January 1, 2022** who haven't borrowed any books.
7. **Report branch-wise employee distribution**, listing branch IDs and number of staff members.
8. **Retrieve names of customers who borrowed books in June 2023**.
9. **List all books categorized under "history"** from the book table.
10. **Show branches with more than 5 employees**, along with their employee counts.
